# A Relational Intervention Approach for Unsupervised Dynamics Generalization in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

TensorFlow implementation of "[A Relational Intervention Approach for Unsupervised Dynamics Generalization in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YRq0ZUnzKoZ)" (ICLR 2022).

## Method

![figure](figures/0001.jpg)

An overview of our Relational Intervention approach, where Relational Encoder, Prediction Head and Relational Head are three learnable functions. Specifically, *prediction Loss* enables the 
estimated environmental-specified factor can help the Prediction head to predict the next states, and the *relation Loss* aims to enforce the similarity between factors estimated from the same trajectory or environments.

Because the mediator in other paths *e.g.* $S_t$, $A_t$, may amplify or reduce the causal effect of environmental-specific $Z$, we only consider the direct path from $Z$ to the next state(denote by the red line at Figure \ref{fig:inter} (a)), which means that we need to block all paths with meditors from $\hat{{Z}}$ to $S_{t+1}$.
